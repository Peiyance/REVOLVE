def minimumTime(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """"""
    You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers
    where `grid[row][col]` represents the minimum time required to be able to
    visit the cell `(row, col)`, which means you can visit the cell `(row, col)`
    only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to `grid[row][col]`.
    
    You are standing in the top-left cell of the matrix in the `0th` second, and
    you must move to any adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and
    right. Each move you make takes 1 second.
    
    Return the minimum time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell
    of the matrix. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return `-1`.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: grid = [[0,1,3,2],[5,1,2,5],[4,3,8,6]]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: One of the paths that we can take is the following:
    - at t = 0, we are on the cell (0,0).
    - at t = 1, we move to the cell (0,1). It is possible because grid[0][1] <= 1.
    - at t = 2, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid[1][1] <= 2.
    - at t = 3, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid[1][2] <= 3.
    - at t = 4, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid[1][1] <= 4.
    - at t = 5, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid[1][2] <= 5.
    - at t = 6, we move to the cell (1,3). It is possible because grid[1][3] <= 6.
    - at t = 7, we move to the cell (2,3). It is possible because grid[2][3] <= 7.
    The final time is 7. It can be shown that it is the minimum time possible.
    
    Example 2:
    
    Input: grid = [[0,2,4],[3,2,1],[1,0,4]]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There is no path from the top left to the bottom-right cell.
    
    Constraints:
    
    * `m == grid.length`
    * `n == grid[i].length`
    * `2 <= m, n <= 1000`
    * `4 <= m * n <= 105`
    * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`

    `bi` in the tree.
    
    Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several
    guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:
    
    * Chooses two distinct integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
    * He tells Alice that `u` is the parent of `v` in the tree.
    
    Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where
    `guesses[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates Bob guessed `uj` to be the parent of `vj`.
    
    Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that
    at least `k` of his guesses are `true`.

    The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old

    * Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in `pickOldi` minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.

    * If the bridge is free and no worker is waiting on the right side, and at least one box remains at the old warehouse, the worker on the left side of the river gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the left side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

    You are given a 0-indexed integer array `stations` of length `n`, where

    Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other

    * Note that `|x|` denotes absolute value. For example, `|7 - 5| = 2` and `|3 - 10| = 7`.
    
    The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided

    In one operation, you can swap the values of any two indices of `nums1`. The

    There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer
    array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are
    also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [positionj,
    limitj]` indicates that `positionj` is the position of the `jth` factory and
    that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limitj` robots.
    
    The positions of each robot are unique. The positions of each factory are also
    unique. Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially.
    
    All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The
    direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When
    a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs
    the robot, and it stops moving.
    
    At any moment, you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot.
    Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.
    
    Return the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots. The test cases
    are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.
    
    Note that
    
    * All robots move at the same speed.
    * If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
    * If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
    * If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
    * If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: As shown in the figure:
    - The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    - The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    - The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
    The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
    The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.
    
    Example 2:
    
    Input: robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: As shown in the figure:
    - The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
    - The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.

    * `-109 <= robot[i], positionj <= 109`
